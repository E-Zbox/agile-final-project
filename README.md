### FINAL PROJECT SCENARIO 👩‍💻📉

In this scenario, you will play the roles of a **product owner**, **scrum master**, and **developer**. As a **product owner**, you will create stories for your team and organize these stories into a product backlog. As a **scrum master**, you will create a sprint milestone and make sure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in a sprint plan. As a **developer**, you will create the sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint. 

Your team has been asked to develop the backend product catalog for an e-commerce website. Your **stakeholders** need the ability to create products, retrieve products, update products, and delete products from the catalog. They have also asked for the ability for customers to indicate that they "like a product and have the site display the like count on the product page.” In addition to the catalog functionality, they have asked that it be hosted on a cloud environment with automated deployments. 

Your team will use [*ZenHub*](https://app.zenhub.com) to provide a kanban board to create a backlog and sprint plan for this work. As the **product owner**, you will be driving the process. You need to leverage the skills you learned in the lessons and labs to create a *new GitHub repository* and *ZenHub kanban board* and fill the kanban board with issues that will become your user stories.
